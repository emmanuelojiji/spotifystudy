# Spotify Study [CONCEPT] - In Development https://romantic-cori-8546e9.netlify.app/

Spotify Study is an app which allows users to choose from three work modes while they listen to music from their Spotify playlists. It will allow users to track amount of time spent working, stay focused and productive. 

Also introducing..Spotify Mood. Users can listen to relaxing sounds such as rainfall, ocean waves, campfire etc.

Currently thinking of other features to make it more exciting!
